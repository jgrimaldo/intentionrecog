**Predictive Intention Recognition Dataset for Collaborative Assembly**

**Description**

This dataset is part of the research work "Predictive intention recognition using deep learning for collaborative assembly" presented at CoDIT 2024 as part of the RICAIP project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 857306. The dataset includes hundreds of short videos capturing workers engaged in different assembly tasks. Each frame within the videos has been annotated with human hands and assembly product components, serving as the primary input for Long-Short Term Memories (LSTMs) to predict human intentions in real-time.

- Hand Segmentation Dataset: contains the entire set of images used to train the YOLACT model as well as their annotations.

- LSTM Dataset Sample: A small portion of the data used to train the LSTM model which we are not at liberty to publish due to project constraints. Contains short video samples and extracted frames with annotations.

**Usage**

This dataset is intended for research purposes, specifically for the development and testing of models aimed at predicting human intentions in collaborative environments. Researchers and developers can use this data to train and validate their models. Unblurred images of individuals appearing in this dataset should not be used in any publications or papers without permission.
